# 7-Segment Display Arduino Code

This Arduino code is designed for controlling a 7-segment display, showcasing numbers 0 to 9 and then cycling back from 9 to 0.

## Overview

The provided Arduino code demonstrates the use of a common anode 7-segment display. It cycles through the numbers 0 to 9 and then reverses the sequence, displaying each digit for one second.

## Usage

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the common anode 7-segment display to your Arduino.
   - Adjust the `segmentPins` array to match your specific pin configuration.

2. **Upload Code:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Load the `seven_segment_display.ino` file.
   - Upload the code to your Arduino board.

3. **Observe Display:**
   - After uploading, the 7-segment display will cycle through numbers 0 to 9 and then back from 9 to 0, displaying each digit for one second.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code based on your requirements:

- **Pin Configuration:**
  Adjust the `segmentPins` array in the code to match your specific wiring configuration.

- **Display Timing:**
  Modify the `delay` duration to adjust how long each digit is displayed. Currently set to 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
