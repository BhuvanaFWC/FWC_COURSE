# AVR GCC Code for Arduino (Uploaded via OTG Cable)

This repository contains AVR GCC code for Arduino, designed to be uploaded directly using an OTG (On-The-Go) cable with the Arduino Droid app. The AVR GCC toolchain is used to compile and upload the code to an Arduino board.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Board:** The code is intended to run on an Arduino board.

- **OTG Cable:** An On-The-Go cable is used to connect the Arduino board to an Android device for direct uploading.
