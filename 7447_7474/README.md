# FlipFlops (7474) and 7-Segment Display Code

This repository contains the code for interfacing two 7474 Flip-Flops and a 7447 BCD to 7-segment display driver. The combination of these components is commonly used in digital electronics to create counters and display numeric values on a 7-segment display.

## Components Used

- **7474 Flip-Flop:** These are dual D-type positive-edge-triggered flip-flops with individual set and reset inputs. The code utilizes two of these to create a simple counter.

- **7447 BCD to 7-segment Display Driver:** This component converts Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) input into the 7-segment display format. It simplifies the process of displaying numeric values on a 7-segment display.
