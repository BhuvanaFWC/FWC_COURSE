# Assembly Language Code for Boolean Equation on Arduino Droid

This repository contains Assembly language code for Arduino Droid, specifically designed to solve a boolean equation and verify whether two equations produce the same output. The code is intended to be uploaded directly to an Arduino board using the Arduino Droid app.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Board:** The code is intended to run on an Arduino board.

- **Arduino Droid App:** The Arduino Droid app is used to upload the Assembly language code to the Arduino board.

## Code Files

1. **boolean_equation.asm:** Assembly language code that solves a boolean equation. The code includes logic to evaluate the equation and compare the results of two different boolean equations.

## Usage

1. **Arduino Droid App:** Utilize the Arduino Droid app on an Android device to directly upload the Assembly language code to the Arduino board. Follow the app's instructions for proper configuration.

2. **Boolean Equation:** Modify the `boolean_equation.asm` file to include the boolean equations you want to evaluate. Ensure that the logic for comparison is correctly implemented.

3. **Verify Output:** After uploading the code, monitor the output to check whether both equations produce the same result.
